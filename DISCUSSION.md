## Model Performance
We evaluated several machine learning models for predicting student depression. The best-performing model was **Random Forest**, achieving an accuracy of **89%** on the validation set.

## Feature Importance
Key indicators contributing to the model's predictions included:
- Sleep quality and duration
- Academic stress levels
- Physical activity
- Social support

These features align well with known psychological factors related to depression.

## Limitations
- The dataset is imbalanced and might not reflect all demographic groups.
- Self-reported data may be biased or inaccurate.
- External factors like family background, diet, or screen time were not considered.

## Future Improvements
- Collect a more diverse and larger dataset.
- Use deep learning models like LSTM for time-based indicators.
- Apply cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning.
- Add explainability techniques like SHAP to visualize feature impact.

## Ethical Considerations
Predicting mental health conditions involves sensitive data. It's essential to:
- Protect privacy and anonymize all data
- Avoid misuse of predictions
- Ensure informed consent in any real-world application

**Conclusion:**  
This project shows promising results in using machine learning to identify students at risk of depression. However, it must be deployed with caution, ethical oversight, and further validation.
